clueweb09-en0000-00-07898 	 The Seed is the horticultural magazine of the Nebraska Statewide Arboretum. It is published twice a year for the members of the Arboretum. This issue was written by Karma Larsen. Copyright 2001. For a full version of this publication with visuals, photographs, charts, landscape designs, etc. call 402-472-2971. The Seed, Fall 2001 Vines and Climbers Why vines? Maybe it's simply that we prefer green. There are plenty of structures in our lives houses, garages, fences, clotheslines, mailboxes, compost bins. Vines meld and soften all the hard edges, blurring the boundaries between garden and fence and gutter and house, extending green far into places where no garden exists. They can provide quick privacy, screen buildings or parking lots, give shade-some of them within just a month or two, define and separate distinct areas in a garden. Areas that are awkwardly shaped can be softened with vines. Many vines have beautiful blossoms and good fall color; a few are evergreen in Nebraska. Though vines tend to be used as climbers, they also work well as groundcovers, twisting around rocks and through low-growing perennials and shrubs, adding dramatic bursts of color when blooming. Like any groundcover plant, they function much like a mulch, shading the roots of perennials and competing with weeds. Vines extend themselves in a variety of ways and the differences are important in deciding which plant to put in a particular spot or to climb an existing structure. Twining vines like honeysuckle and morning glory wrap around their support so they require fairly thin surfaces like wire, string, netting, small poles and slats. Clasping vines like clematis, grape and porcelain berry also require thin wire or netting for support but in their case the entire stem doesn't spiral but has tendrils, specialized stems, that wrap around the structure. Clinging vines, on the other hand, cannot attach themselves to netting or string. Their aerial roots or "holdfasts" adhere to almost any flat surface but they prefer slightly rough surfaces like unpolished stone or brick or rough bark. Examples are Boston and English ivy. It's important to know the eventual size or weight of the vine. The trunks of some clinging vines, climbing hydrangea for example, are woody and can require strong support in just a few growing seasons. Some nonwoody and even annual vines can grow so rapidly that they, too, require considerable support. Since some of the perennial vines are fairly slow-growing, I've included suggestions for a few annual vines within each section that might be helpful if you're starting an arbor and want quick growth and coverage while perennial vines are getting established. Twining Vines American bittersweet, Celastrus scandens, is a woody vine native to Nebraska. Its strongest ornamental feature is its colorful autumn fruit, an orange capsule opening to reveal red seeds underneath. It bears best in full sun and foliage turns bright yellow in the fall. The fruits are favored by "turkey, grouse, quail, pheasants, mockingbirds, catbirds, bluebirds, cedar waxwings and cardinals" according to a newsletter of the UNLBGA Maxwell Arboretum. The fragrant flowers of goldflame (Lonicera x heckrottii) and trumpet honeysuckle (Lonicera sempervirens) have a long period of bloom, opening intermittently until frost and giving way to bright red berries. They are favored by birds, particularly hummingbirds. The plants grow to about 15' and like well-drained soil; they may be susceptible to mildew if grown in shade. Dutchman's pipe, Aristolochia macrophylla, is a fast grower, extending to 30' in one year. Its heart-shaped leaves can grow to 1' in diameter, making it ideal for screening and fast shade. Early summer flowers are followed by capsule-like fruits. Some sources recommend planting it away from the house since its fly-pollinated flowers are somewhat smelly. Chocolate vine, Akebia quinata, is known both for its semi-evergreen foliage and vanilla-scented dark maroon flowers in early spring. Small, fleshy purple fruits follow. It can grow to 30' and prefers moist but well-drained soil. The sight or smell of a wisteria in full bloom is not easily forgotten. Drooping clusters of lilac-colored flowers can be 18" in length. Bean-like velvety green seed pods follow. For Japanese wisteria, Wisteria floribunda, flowers occur in April or May. The blossoms of American wisteria, Wisteria frutescens, are somewhat less showy and occur June to August. American wisteria blooms on new wood and should be pruned annually. Japanese wisteria need only be pruned as needed to keep it in bounds. It requires strong support since a mature one can grow to 20-30'. Jan Riggenbach, gardening columnist for the Omaha World-Herald, recommends starting with a grafted plant since "seedlings may take ten years or more to flower." In her Midwest Gardener's Handbook, she writes "If you've done everything right and waited patiently, and yet your wisteria still won't bloom, try root pruning: slice down through the soil with a sharp spade, as if you were beginning to dig up the plant." Silver lace vine, Polygonum aubertii, has showy small, white flowers in late summer followed by translucent fruit. A fast grower, it can grow to 25' in one season. There are a number of annual twining vines that might be helpful if you're wanting quick cover while waiting for some of the slower-growing perennials to get established. The fruits of hardy kiwi, Actinidia arguta, are edible, ripening in autumn. Harlan Hamernik, owner of Bluebird Nursery, Inc. in Clarkson, particularly likes the variegated forms, Actinidia kolomikta 'Arctic Beauty' which has white flowers and variegated purplish leaves with splashes of white and pink on 3-5 year old plants, and Actinidia polygama with splashes of silver-white on the foliage. Another favorite of Harlan's is hops vine, Humulus lupulus 'Aureus', which has pale green foliage and cone-like fruits and also comes in variegated forms. Scarlet runner bean (Kennedia prostrata) grows to only about 5'. Scarlet pea-like flowers bloom throughout the summer and into autumn. Morning glory and another member of the morning glory family, cardinal climber (Ipomoea spp. and Ipomoea x multifida), prefer full sun and well-drained soil and grow from 6-20'. The flowers of cardinal climber are a deep crimson with white throats, while morning glories bloom in a variety of colors throughout the summer. Black-eyed Susan vine, Thunbergia alata, is another possibility for a quick-growing annual vine. Flowers are white, bright orange or yellow, usually with deep, chocolate-purple centers and they bloom all summer. Clasping Vines Clematis may be the most loved and best-known of all vines. The varieties hardy to Nebraska offer a wide variety of bloom color, bloom time (from spring through autumn), fragrance and even shape of the flower. Clematis grows best "with its feet in the shade and its head in the sun." If it is in full sun, plant it on the north side of a fence, shrub or perennial and cover it with mulch to keep the soil at its base moist and shaded. Good supports for clematis include wire screen, netting or narrow wooden lath. Clematis may take several seasons to flower. Clematis montana is one of the early bloomers, offering white or pink vanilla-scented blossoms in May. Downy clematis blooms in May and June. Clematis macropetala 'Markham's Pink' has semi-double flowers of mauve and purple, and 'White Swan' has 2-2 ½" white flowers. Jackman clematis, Clematis x jackmanii, is a reliable, well-known favorite that does well in full sun or deep shade. Velvety violet-purple blossoms are 3-4" across in mid and late summer and vines grow to about 12'. The abundant, bell-shaped yellow flowers of golden clematis, Clematis tangutica, that occur midsummer to late autumn give way to beautiful silken seed heads. The flowers of sweet autumn clematis, Clematis terniflora (previously C. paniculata or C. maximowicziana), are larger-4-5" in diameter, vary in color from white to purple to deep red depending on the variety, are almond-scented and bloom in early fall. The common name of porcelain berry reveals its most showy ornamental quality. The fruits of Ampelopsis brevipedunculata progress from green to light and then darker blue and then into deepening shades of purple. Since these colors often occur at the same time, the result is quite showy. Fruiting will be heaviest if the vine is grown in full sun and root growth is restricted. The vine grows to 15' and can become invasive, so a confined site is recommended. The fall foliage of some grapevines, particularly Vitis amurensis and V. coignetiae, can be stunning flaming red, crimson or purple. The leaves of 'Variegata' are splashed with white. Vitis riparia offers excellent fruit for jelly or wine. All grapes are vigorous climbers and the shredding, woody bark is appealing throughout the year. For annual clasping vines, there is passion vine and sweet pea. Sweet pea is a clasping vine that occurs both as an annual, Lathyrus odoratus, and a perennial, Lathyrus latifolius. The flowers of both are intensely colored and the vines grow 6-8'; flowers of Lathyrus odoratus are fragrant. Sweet peas can tolerate shade, but they do best in sun and bloom better in the heat than most vines. Few vines have flowers as exotic or intricate as the passionflower. The blossoms are fragrant and attractive to butterflies and hummingbirds. Blossoms of Passiflora caerulea are sky-blue and white; a dramatic red for Passiflora coccinea. The vines can grow to 30'. Clinging Vines Any flat surface is suitable for the growth of clinging vines. The slightly rough surface of unpolished stone or brick works well. Though the aerial roots or "holdfasts" will attach themselves to wood surfaces, clinging vines are not recommended for wood because the dense growth of these vines allows no air circulation, providing an ideal environment for fungus. Also, if the wood surface will require painting, removal of the aerial roots of clinging vines is a painstaking and time-consuming process. Climbing hydrangea, Hydrangea anomala petiolaris, bears clusters of fragrant white flowers in early summer. The foliage is lush and dark green and the bark of older plants is peeling and cinnamon-colored. Though slow to establish, this vigorous, woody vine can grow to 50' so it should be grown on a structure that can bear the weight of the mature plant. The large palmate leaves of Virginia creeper, Parthenocissus quinquefolia, are bright red in autumn. A woody that can grow to 50', the berries and the cover it provides make it attractive to a variety of wildlife. Another plant in this genus is Boston ivy, Parthenocissus tricuspidata. It can grow 50' or more and the large, three-lobed leaves also have beautiful fall color. It can take sun or shade and almost any soil conditions. Evergreen If you're looking for evergreen climbers, two possibilities are English ivy, Hedera helix, and wintercreeper, Euonymus fortunei. Both are clasping vines that require a solid surface for support. English ivy has glossy, dark green foliage that can become red or purple in cold weather. It grows best in fertile, well-drained soil. Cultivars of Hedera helix can be chartreuse, variegated, white-veined or purple and can range from very narrow foliage to almost circular, ruffled leaves. Wintercreeper also has many cultivars. Some varieties can climb to 15' if supported, though most stay under 5'. Variegated ones require full sun to achieve best coloring. It is susceptible to scale and can suffer winter burn so is best grown in areas sheltered from drying winds. Overall Most vines require pruning only to keep them within bounds. With just a few exceptions, the vines listed in this issue can be pruned as needed at any time. Since the clematis that bloom in early summer (Clematis montana and C. macropetala) flower on the previous year's shoots, they should only be pruned after flowering. It's possible to get two periods of bloom from later blooming clematis like Clematis x jackmanii by pruning one side of the plant in January or February and the other side two months later. Since the vines intertwine, flowers will be distributed throughout the vine. Non-blooming wisteria should be pruned only as desired. The side shoots of flowering wisteria should be pinched back after the blooms fade. Other suggestions: ♦Though any of the twining or clasping vines will work, wisteria and porcelain berry vine are particularly good vines for chain link fences. ♦Most vines do well in sun or part shade. For full shade, possibilities are Dutchman's pipe and ivy. ♦Hummingbirds favor honeysuckle, cardinal climber and passion vine. ♦Fragrant vines include honeysuckle, hydrangea, silver lace vine and sweet pea. ♦Perennial pea, Virginia creeper, wisteria, honeysuckle and silver lace vine are drought-tolerant once established. ♦For quick growth, plant annuals or perennials like sweet autumn clematis, Virginia creeper, grape, silver lace vine or Dutchman's pipe. ♦Grape vines and hardy kiwi produce edible fruits.

Horticultural Society Carolina jasmine 'Margarita' might be a good vine choice for this tight setting. Q: I have a west side yard that is only 4 feet wide, bordered on one side by the house, the other by the property line fence. The view from my home's west-facing windows is horrible - a neighbor's gravel driveway filled with old cars and weeds, and at level view, inside the neighbor's home. Besides hiding the view, I'd like to cut down on noise from the nearby freeway and the neighbors' nightly "joyfulness." I'm thinking of some kind of tall-growing, flowering, year-round planting that I can keep trimmed to a narrow space. Any ideas or suggestions? I live in California. A: A vine is a great choice for a tight space like this. If you want coverage all year, you're looking at an evergreen vine. Hopefully you're in a warmer winter-hardiness zone than we are here in Zone 6 central Pennsylvania. We have very few evergreen vines hardy enough here to keep their leaves over winter... mainly ivies and sometimes Carolina jasmine (Gelsemium sempervirens). Continue reading the entry...

Screening out utilities Posted by gweigel July 17, 2008 17:43PM Categories: Design Questions, Plant Selection, Vines By George Weigel/The Patriot-News Q: There is a very unattractive group of utility meters on my condo exterior that I'd like to disguise. Many of my neighbors have used climbing roses on trellises, but the way my place is located, there is not as much sun as I think they need. Another neighbor has a clematis vine that is beautiful but doesn't seem to bloom all that long. Plus the clematis I looked at were so small it would take forever for them to achieve the purpose. Do you have any recommendations for something that's fairly quick-growing, attractive for most of the summer and does OK in part shade? A: A vine on a trellis is a great way to screen off utilities in small spaces. Just be sure you allow enough room for access to the meters. The meter readers no doubt would appreciate if you avoided roses, too! Continue reading the entry...

Ideas for a side-yard garden with a curving path Posted by gweigel July 02, 2008 15:57PM Categories: Design Questions By George Weigel/The Patriot-News Q: I have a side yard that's about 9 to 10 feet wide by 30 feet long. I want to create a pathway to the backyard with plantings on either side. On the east side is my neighbor's yard, some deciduous trees and our picket fence. On the west is our red brick garage wall. I would like a path of about 2 feet for walking - curving down the middle. I'd like to put some small trees under the larger trees but am afraid it is too narrow. Do you have any suggestions? A: It's a little hard to make detailed and specific suggestions without seeing the site, but I can give you a few general thoughts... Continue reading the entry...

Living privacy fence Posted by gweigel February 08, 2008 09:19AM Categories: Design Questions, Evergreens, Plant Selection By George Weigel/The Patriot-News Q: I'm looking for a plant that will provide a 15 to 20-foot-high privacy fence in an area about 25 feet square - the faster the better. The area is well-drained and in a full-sun location. I am thinking about bamboo, but don't know how it will blend in with the property. A: Bamboo would do the trick, but the problem is that the common, hardy running types don't know when to quit. (See the earlier posting at left under "Plant Selection" and "Bamboo for Dry Shale" for more on this.) Unless you have no nearby neighbors or a natural barrier - or can install a buried barrier to keep the bamboo within that area - I'd suggest moving on to Plan B. Continue reading the entry...

Plants for a shady side yard Posted by gweigel January 30, 2008 14:47PM Categories: Design Questions, Plant Selection By George Weigel/The Patriot-News Q: I just put an addition on my house that left about 30 feet between the house and my neighbor's line of blue spruce. This area receives very little, if any, direct sunlight. The grass is slowing dying. I want to do some kind of landscaping but haven't a clue as to what type of shrubs or flowers would provide color/contrast with little or direct sunlight. Do you have any suggestions?

Where to site a rain garden Posted by gweigel January 11, 2008 16:25PM Categories: Design Questions, Miscellaneous Questions By George Weigel/The Patriot-News Q: I'm thinking of putting in a rain garden this year, and I was wondering, how far away from the house should it be? I have a particularly weird downspout spot that runs all of that wonderful rain water straight down the driveway. A: Great move. It makes sense to me to put storm water into the ground instead of channeling it off into the storm sewers and waterways. And you'll end up with a new garden, too! Continue reading the entry...

Edging plant for front walk Posted by gweigel December 18, 2007 09:20AM Categories: Design Questions, Evergreens, Plant Selection By George Weigel/The Patriot-News Q: I have a walkway going up to the house, and I had some midget arborvitae planted next to it. I don't really like it and will probably have these plants moved somewhere else. I want something with height there and year-round color. Any ideas on what to plant? Should it be low? A: I'm not a big dwarf arb fan either. I like dwarf boxwoods better as a low, evergreen walk edging. My favorite cultivar is 'Green Velvet,' but also nice as 'Chicagoland Green,' 'Green Mound,' 'Green Ice,' 'Franklin's Gem' and 'Justin Brouwers.' These give an elegant Williamsburgy look and also can be neatly sheared or left loosely rounded -- whichever look you prefer. Continue reading the entry...

Planting under trees... when sun becomes shade Posted by gweigel December 14, 2007 11:13AM Categories: Design Questions, Evergreens, Groundcovers, Plant Selection, Trees By George Weigel/The Patriot-News Q: We have two young 'Heritage' birch trees and a young weeping crabapple tree planted in a triangular pattern out front. We'd like to fill in the triangle with some easy-maintenance plants that will give it year-round interest, especially in the winter, when there's not much to look at. Any ideas? It's been confusing because right now the area gets primarily sun, but as the trees grow, there will be more shade. A: This is a common dilemma because your site starts out in sun and turns into shade. Sounds like what you need are some relatively low evergreens that can take the sun but also tolerate shade.

Horticultural Society Carolina jasmine 'Margarita' might be a good vine choice for this tight setting. Q: I have a west side yard that is only 4 feet wide, bordered on one side by the house, the other by the property line fence. The view from my home's west-facing windows is horrible - a neighbor's gravel driveway filled with old cars and weeds, and at level view, inside the neighbor's home. Besides hiding the view, I'd like to cut down on noise from the nearby freeway and the neighbors' nightly "joyfulness." I'm thinking of some kind of tall-growing, flowering, year-round planting that I can keep trimmed to a narrow space. Any ideas or suggestions? I live in California. A: A vine is a great choice for a tight space like this. If you want coverage all year, you're looking at an evergreen vine. Hopefully you're in a warmer winter-hardiness zone than we are here in Zone 6 central Pennsylvania. We have very few evergreen vines hardy enough here to keep their leaves over winter... mainly ivies and sometimes Carolina jasmine (Gelsemium sempervirens). Continue reading the entry...

Compact evergreen for shade Posted by GEORGE WEIGEL, The Patriot-News October 28, 2008 14:53PM Categories: Evergreens, Plant Selection George Weigel Dwarf Hinoki cypress is a good, compact evergreen that's fairly shade tolerant. Q: Could you please recommend a small- to medium-sized compact evergreen I could grow in a shady border? A: Most evergreens prefer full sun, but a few that I like that are both compact and shade-tolerant are: boxwoods such as 'Green Velvet,' 'Chicagoland Green,' 'Green Mountain,' 'Justin Brouwers' and 'Green Ice;' dwarf Hinoki cypress; globe arborvitae 'Hetz Midget;' dwarf arborvitae 'Holmstrupp;' cotoneaster 'Little Gem;' cherry laurel 'Mt. Vernon;' dwarf nandina 'Firepower,' 'Harbour Dwarf' or 'Moon Bay;' osmanthus 'Goshiki,' and rhododendron 'Ken Janeck.' Most of those are broad-leafed evergreens in the 3- to 5-foot range. The needled ones are arborvitae and Hinoki cypress. Cherry laurel gets small flowers, and rhodie 'Ken Janeck' gets rosy buds followed by pink flowers that turn white. The nandina has colorful foliage.

Shrubs for dry shade Posted by GEORGE WEIGEL, The Patriot-News October 06, 2008 09:26AM Categories: Plant Selection, Shrubs George Weigel Fall color of viburnum 'Winterthur.' Q: I'm looking for suggestions for shrubs in a shady and dry area. Are any viburnums suitable for shade? I have an area I am trying to give a natural, woodsy look. I also was thinking of a holly or a conifer for winter cover for the birds. A: Viburnum would be a great family to start with. I particularly like the native Viburnum nudum in a wooded setting, especially two beautiful cultivars named 'Winterthur' and the new 'Brandywine,' both of which get blue fruits. Also look at arrowwood viburnums (V. dentatum) and particularly the new 'Blue Muffin' cultivar of that. Continue reading the entry...

Discolored Japanese maple Posted by GEORGE WEIGEL, The Patriot-News September 16, 2008 11:15AM Categories: Plant Selection, Trees George Weigel Red-leafed Japanese maples may discolor or brown around the edges in hot, windy sites. Q: I planted two Japanese maples in May on the west-facing side of my home. I live in North Carolina where the summers are very hot and the tree gets hot afternoon sun. I noticed that the leaves on one of the trees have gone from red to pale green and the edges are white and dry-looking. The other tree is fine. I'm wondering if it's too hot for the tree. They get regularly scheduled watering from an irrigation system. I saw no signs of insect infestation. A: I think your hunch is right... a hot, west-facing, North Carolina wall is a tough assignment for a Japanese maple. These are thin-leafed trees that often bleach out colorwise in intense heat and sun, and they lose moisture quickly around the leaf tips and margins. Continue reading the entry...

Driveway alternative to fried-out hostas Posted by gweigel August 21, 2008 09:49AM Categories: Perennials, Plant Selection, Shrubs By George Weigel/The Patriot-News Q: We have a long winding driveway and currently have hostas planted along the entire left side. They look awful and are becoming brown and raggedy-looking. We want to get rid of them. Any suggestions on what kind of shrubs or grasses to plant along the driveway that can take the full sun? I like ornamental grasses but would not want something that gets too big. A: The hostas are frying out from the full sun and heat from the nearby paving. Most hostas do better in at least part shade - especially thin-leafed and variegated types. Salt residue from ice-melters in winter also sometimes contribute to this leaf browning. They'd no doubt look and perform a lot better if you can move them a shadier spot. Continue reading the entry...

Screening out utilities Posted by gweigel July 17, 2008 17:43PM Categories: Design Questions, Plant Selection, Vines By George Weigel/The Patriot-News Q: There is a very unattractive group of utility meters on my condo exterior that I'd like to disguise. Many of my neighbors have used climbing roses on trellises, but the way my place is located, there is not as much sun as I think they need. Another neighbor has a clematis vine that is beautiful but doesn't seem to bloom all that long. Plus the clematis I looked at were so small it would take forever for them to achieve the purpose. Do you have any recommendations for something that's fairly quick-growing, attractive for most of the summer and does OK in part shade? A: A vine on a trellis is a great way to screen off utilities in small spaces. Just be sure you allow enough room for access to the meters. The meter readers no doubt would appreciate if you avoided roses, too! Continue reading the entry...

Annuals for west-facing window boxes Posted by gweigel June 23, 2008 14:36PM Categories: Annuals, Container Gardening, Plant Selection By George Weigel/The Patriot-News Q: I have window boxes hanging on the rail of my west-facing deck. Which annuals would tolerant this exposure with minimal care? I'd like something tall for the middle and trailing on each end. A: This gets the hot afternoon sun, so you're best going with plants that can take full sun and heat. Some of my favorites in that setting: Taller ones for the middle: purple angelonia, blue salvia, celosia 'Fresh Look Red,' dusty miller, marigolds, ornamental hot pepper 'Black Pearl,' pentas, the 'Profusion' series of zinnias and vinca. Good trailers: Petunias, verbena, the new trailing 'Nirvana Cascade' vinca, dichondra 'Silver Falls,' licorice vine (Helichrysum petiolare) and any of the ornamental sweet potato vines.

Evergreens for wet soil Posted by gweigel June 17, 2008 14:16PM Categories: Evergreens, Plant Selection By George Weigel/The Patriot-News Q: We have a large sloped yard with a stream at the bottom. We would like to plant an evergreen on the north side of the yard to act as a windblock and also to block the view of a busy road. The area is about 30 to 40 feet from the stream, and the ground is very wet and mushy a lot of the time. It may dry out a little during a string of hot summer days... but mostly it's wet. Is there anything we can plant there that will keep foliage all year and grow tall enough to block the road? A: Soggy soil is the kiss of death for most evergreens. One tall evergreen that's found naturally in wet areas near stream banks is the Atlantic white cedar, which is technically a falsecypress (Chamaecyparis thyoides). It's narrow and upright in habit, a mid-Atlantic native, somewhat similar to an upright juniper in appearance and slightly bluish/green in color. Continue reading the entry...

Our front porch gets full sun in the afternoons. I've had some luck with petunias and geraniums but am looking for something different. A: Some of my favorite heat- and sun-tolerant hanging-basket annuals (besides petunias) are the new 'Dragon Wing' and 'Dragon Wing Pink' begonias; any lantana; million bells (Calibrachoa); the 'Temari,' 'Aztec,' 'Lanai,' 'Superbena' or 'Tukana' series of verbena; the new 'Nirvana' series of trailing vinca; 'Diamond Frost' euphorbia; ornamental sweet potato vines (i.e. 'Marguerite,' 'Ace of Spades' and 'Blackie'); the fuzzy-gray licorice vine (Helichrysum petiolare) and a long, trailing, silver vine called dichondra 'Silver Falls.' Be sure to water regularly - probably daily in full sun baskets. Even heat-lovers need ample moisture. Hanging baskets dry quickly in sun.

Tree for a brick planter Posted by gweigel June 09, 2008 09:34AM Categories: Plant Selection, Trees By George Weigel/The Patriot-News Q: We have a brick planter by our deck that measures 3 feet by 4 feet and is 4 feet deep. We previously had a river birch tree in it, but the roots grew under the brick patio and sidewalk, resulting in having to replace everything. We loved the shade. I was thinking it would help to put some kind of weed cloth in the planter before filling it with dirt. Someone recommended we replant with a crape myrtle. The planter gets at least 6 hours of sun. A: That's pretty close to the deck for a tree. Most trees put out vigorous enough roots that they'd also eventually push up brick - some moreso than others. Ordinary weed fabric or black plastic would do little to stop it. Continue reading the entry... Tags: geomembranes, root barriers, small trees, trees for planters Post a comment |

clueweb09-en0000-01-17129 	 The BetterWorld Movement Join the global movement for a better world What's your Issue for a better world? CIVIL RIGHTS Civil Rights are the rights and privileges to which we are entitled under the laws that govern our nation. In America, our civil rights are guaranteed in the Constitution, particularly in the Bill of Rights and other Amendments. Even though the Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves in 1865 and the 13th Amendment outlawed slavery and guaranteed black Americans the rights to which all American citizens are entitled, many black Americans in the South were not allowed to exercise their civil rights, even until the 1960s. The Civil Rights Movement in the United States helped to win equality for all Americans. In 1987, a Presidential Proclamation declared August 12 to be commemorated as Civil Rights Day. This day is an opportunity to honor those who worked to help create an America where all Americans' civil rights are protected. It is also a time to stand up for the continuing protection of our civil rights guaranteed in the Constitution. In recent years, some have suggested that Martin Luther King Day be observed as Civil Rights Day to commemorate the greater cause to which Dr. King and so many others dedicated their lives for the good of us all.

clueweb09-en0000-03-10029 	 The Historic Adobe Architecture of Santa Fe, New Mexico Today, many of Santa Fes 400-year-old structures still stand, and they are found throughout a number of areas in what could be called the inner city. Considering that the construction material used in these buildings is vulnerable to summer rains and winter snows, it speaks volumes for the long-lasting architectural miracle called adobe. The Plaza Area The Palace of the Governors This adobe structure (pictured right) dates back to the early 17th century and is the oldest public building in the United States. In 1610, Pedro de Peralta, the newly appointed governor of the Spanish territory covering most of the American Southwest, began construction on the Palace of the Governors. In the following years, the Palace changed hands as the territory of New Mexico did, seeing the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Spanish reconquest from 1693 to 1694, Mexican independence in 1821, and finally American possession in 1846. The Palace originally served as the seat of government of the Spanish colony of Nuevo Mexico, which at one time wad comprised of the present-day states of Texas, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, California, and New Mexico. After the Mexican War of Independence, the Mexican Province of New Mexico was administered from the Palace of the Governors. When New Mexico was annexed as a U.S. territory, the Palace became New Mexico's first territorial capitol. During the American Civil War, the building also briefly served as the Confederate Army's regional headquarters. In 1909, when the New Mexico state legislature established the Museum of New Mexico, the Palace of the Governors became a state history museum. This extraordinary example of adobe architecture was designated a Registered National Historic Landmark in 1960 and an American Treasure in 1999. The Palace of the Governors is located at 105 West Palace Avenue. Museum of Fine Arts The Museum of Fine Arts was founded in 1917 as the Art Gallery of the Museum of New Mexico. This building is considered by many to be the jewel in the crown of the newer adobe architecture in the downtown area.Its Pueblo Revival style clearly set the standard for historic preservation in Santa Fe. The building was designed by I. H. and William M. Rapp, and was based on their New Mexico building at the Panama-California Exposition of 1915. The adobe structure combines aspects of several Southwestern regional styles, including elements of the facades of the Spanish mission churches of Acoma, Laguna and San Felipe Pueblos. For more than eighty-five years the Museum has collected and exhibited work by artists from New Mexico and around the world. The Museum of Fine Arts is located at 107 West Palace Avenue. Burro Alley Once the citys bawdy nightlife district, featuring cantinas, saloon and gambling establishments (and also home to ladies of the night), ironically, this tiny street is named for the burros (pictured right) that carried firewood to be sold there. Burro Alley is located between San Francisco Street and Palace Avenue. Old Santa Fe Trail The Oldest House Known as the oldest house in America (pictured right), it certainly offers a whiff of charm akin to the olden days. Small and quite dark inside, the authentic adobe brick construction offers a cool repose from a hot Santa Fe summer day. Across the street from the Oldest Church (located at 401 Santa Fe Trail), it makes for an easy double tourist-trip back in time. Located at 215 East De Vargas Street. Barrio de Analco Located in the East De Vargas Street area, these small adobe buildings were homes in the nations oldest neighborhood, founded in 1610 by Mexican Indian soldiers and Spanish colonists. This district is generally recognized as the second-oldest settlement section in the city. Plenty of true Santa Fe charm can be found here. Barrio de Analco is located south of the Santa Fe River. La Fonda Hotel Once a famed Harvey House, the hotel (pictured right) was built in 1922 on the site of earlier hotels at the end of the Santa Fe Trail. Many special events are held here throughout the year, giving locals a reason to visit this wonderful, welcoming landmark. Located at 100 East San Francisco Street. Also in the area: The Oldest Church East of the Plaza These adobe buildings with their charming courtyards were once spacious family homes. Today, these serve as wonderful examples of the early adobe architecture that has become synonymous with with Santa Fe style. Canyon Road Once an Indian game trail leading to the Pecos Pueblos and then an art colony in the 1920s, this street is now internationally famous for its art galleries. As one of Santa Fes oldest neighborhoods, some of the best examples of authentic adobe architecture can be found here. Canyon Road begins at Paseo de Peralta. El Zaguan The fortified-style house, built with four-foot-thick walls, and featuring a public Victorian garden, is an authentic example of 19th-century Santa Fe architecture. A sprawling Territorial hacienda, this massive adobe structure houses the offices of the Historic Santa Fe Foundation. The large and beautiful flower garden is named for noted archaeologist Adolph Bandelier, who studied the ancient Pueblo Indians, and is honored by the nearby national monument that bears his name. He was one of many illustrious residents of El Zaguan. The house is located at 545 Canyon Road. Randall Davey House Listed in national, state and city registers of historic and cultural buildings, the Randall Davey House is part of the New Mexico Audubon Center. The 16-inch-thick stone walls are now covered by plaster, but the massive, roughly hewn, beamed ceilings of the mill are still visible. The mill's former storeroom was converted to an art studio by Randall Davey. He added large north-facing windows, which look out on the slopes of Santa Fe Canyon. The property was originally part of the Talaya Hill Grant given in 1731 to Manuel Trujillo. Situated three miles from the Plaza, it was primarily used for grazing and woodcutting until the U.S. Army quartermaster built a stone sawmill here in order to provide lumber for the building of Fort Marcy. In 1852, the property was sold to the well-known trader and trapper Colonel Ceran St. Vrain for $550. In 1856, St. Vrain sold the mill machinery to Joseph Hersch and Isaiah Smith who established a new mill downstream on the Santa Fe River. The property then passed through a series of owners, including Captain Candelario Martinez who purchased it in 1892. Martinez was an attorney, postmaster and probate judge in Santa Fe. During his ownership the land was cultivated in corn, oats, alfalfa and fruit trees. In 1920, Randall Davey purchased the property and converted the sawmill into his home. He lived and painted here for the next 44 years. Two murals, "Burros Eating Pears" and the frog on the studio door, were both painted by Davey soon after acquiring the property. Also is this area: Cristo Rey Church Guadalupe Street Barrio de Guadalupe Located in the South Guadalupe Street area. There were once small farms here during Spanish Colonial times. Later, during the heyday of the railroads, it was the commercial hub of the city. The houses found here now are some of the oldest in the Santa Fe, as this neighborhood grew out from the historic Plaza district. Historic Railyard District Now a upgraded commercial park, the railyard houses museums, shops, restaurants and the local Farmers Market. The historic depot building (pictured right) has been carefully preserved. On the streets branching off from the railyard are some fine examples of early adobe architecture.

In this way, they passed through several turquoise and sapphire galleries. It was magnificently beautiful, but they were in the Kingdom of the Future, where Time was the great master, and they must escape from his anger whichgiven to him by He was so where he was going; his joy rang a victorious peal in his head that made him feel giddy; he was mad with pride; and this, worse luck, made him lose his coolness and his presence of mind! They were just about to cross the threshold of the palace, when a gust of wind swept through the entrance-hall, lifting up Light's veil and at last revealing the two Children to the eyes of Time, who was still pursuing them. With a roar of rage, he darted they had braved. Mytyl was terribly frightened and Tyltyl kept nervously turning round to Light. "Don't be afraid," she said. "I am the only person whom Time has respected since the world began. Only mind that you take care of the Blue Bird. He's gorgeous! He is quite, quite blue!" This thought enraptured the boy. He felt the precious treasure fluttering in his arms; his hands dared not press the pretty creature's soft, warm wings; and his heart beat against its heart. This time, he held the Blue Bird!

"I'm so frightened! What had happened? How painful to him just then! He had started on his journey with such zest and delight that he had not thought for a moment of the difficulties and dangers.

"Remember that we are bringing back the Blue Bird!" As he spoke, a thin ray of light pierced the gloom; and the little boy hurried towards it. He was holding his cage tight in his arms; and the first thing he did was to look at his bird .... Alas and alack, what a disappointment awaited him!

clueweb09-en0000-04-12848 	 Asus Eee News, Mods, and Hacks Sponsored Link Amazon Carousel Amazon.com Widgets Tuesday, January 6, 2009 HP Mini 2140 with Atom, 10" LCD From Electronista - HP has introduced the Mini 2140, which replaces the Mini-Note 2133. Curiously, the new model uses a 1.6GHz Intel Atom instead of the 2133's VIA C7-M. Screen size has been increased to 10" with support for the original, extra-sharp 1366x768 display and a lesser 1024x576 resolution. Storage has been upgraded to 80GB SSD/160GB HD while OS choices have been expanded to Windows XP Home/Professional, SuSE Linux, FreeDOS or Windows Vista Home Basic/Premium. The new model will be available later this month with prices starting at $499.

Coins * Email * * Coins * Start Collecting * Buy & Sell * Coin Profiles * Free Coins Newsletter!Sign Up * Discuss in my Forum What Are These Old Coins? By Susan Headley, About.com See More About: * old coins * coin values * identification * rare coins Question: What Are These Old Coins? Old coins can be hard to identify and put values or prices on if you don't even know what the old coin is called. Is your old coin made of silver or gold? What country is the old coin from? This FAQ will help you figure out what your old coins are, and lead to resources for further information about them. Answer: The first step to finding out what your old coins are worth is to identify them. If they are from the United States, you can check the U.S. Old Coins Identification chart. Old coins from the United States will always say "United States of America" on them, although sometimes this is abbreviated on very old U.S. coins. If the old coin from the U.S. isn't on the chart, it is probably a commemorative coin, rather than a circulating coin. For help with old commemorative coins, you are best off getting a copy of the U.S. Coins Red Book. Old Coins From Outside the U.S. If your old coins do not say they are from the U.S., they will usually name some other country. In most cases, you should be able to make out what the country is, although it will usually be in the language of the country that issued the old coin. You can type the likely country name into a search engine such as Google to see what is available on the Web. There are thousands of coin-related Web sites out there for just about every type of old coin imaginable! If the old coin doesn't have a country name that you can read, you can try visiting Don's World Coin Gallery to look it up. Don's Web site has over 25,000 photos of coins from more than 400 countries, past and present, and his Instant Identifiers page has images of dozens of coins that lack English inscriptions. Just match your old coin to the images, and click the image to get to his information and value page. Old Coins That Can't be Identified Not all of your old coins will be identifiable using the methods above. In this case, you might have a token, round, or pattern, all of which resemble coins. Try typing the inscriptions you can read into a search engine. As a general rule, if the old coin doesn't have a country name and denomination (saying how much it's worth) on it, it's probably not an official government coin. It can be very hard to learn more about these unofficial coins because very few people collect them, so they're usually not worth very much (if any) money. Researching Old Coins Here are some tips for researching your old coins: * Don't be afraid to check ebay links if they come up in search for your old coin. Sometimes sellers have a lot of detail about the coins in the auctions, plus you'll get an idea of value. * Be sure to check beyond the first page of search results. Sometimes you won't find what you need until several pages into the listings. * If you find something very similar, but that doesn't quite match your old coin, try emailing whoever's page (or ebay listing) you're on for help! Send a photo of your coin. * Try posting photos of your old coin in forums (like the one here at About.com Coins), or emailing it to coin dealers. Sooner or later someone will recognize it. Although this is rarely my first choice when giving advice about old coins, you can try taking your old coins to a coin dealer and see what he can tell you. The reason I don't like to suggest this is that most coin dealers in the U.S. don't know any more about world coins and other non-coin numismatic items than you'd discover for yourself just searching Google and ebay. Plus, many coin dealers will try to buy your old coins from you at very low prices.

clueweb09-en0000-04-34301 	 Legal Definitions » E » Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Law & Legal Definition Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Law & Legal Definition Related to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission * Ask a Lawyer * Legal Forms * Related Services + Document Preparation Service The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was established to enforce provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII forbids discrimination in the workplace based on race, age, disability, religion, sex, or national origin. Title VII covers all phases and aspects of employment including but not necessarily restricted to hiring, termination of employment, layoffs, promotions, wages, on-the-job training, and disciplinary action. Businesses covered by Title VII include employers in the private sector with 15 or more employees, educational institutions, state and local governments, labor unions with 15 or more members, employment agencies, and, under certain circumstances, labor-management committees. Originally, government-owned corporations, Indian tribes, and federal employees were not covered under the provisions of Title VII; the latter group was protected from discriminatory practices by Executive Order 11478, which was administered and enforced by the U.S. Civil Service Commission. In 1978, however, federal equal employment functions were transferred to the EEOC. Title VII—which, along with the rest of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, became operational on July 2, 1965—has since been amended several times over the years. Key amendments include the Equal Opportunity Act of 1972, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The EEOC is also responsible for enforcing the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (including amendments to Section 501 prohibiting employment discrimination against federal employees with disabilities), and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Today, the EEOC provides oversight and coordination of all federal regulations, practices, and policies affecting equal employment opportunity. ORIGINS OF THE EEOC Title VII and the EEOC trace their beginnings to World War II federal defense contracts. Faced with the threat of a "Negro march" on Washington to protest discrimination in hiring of defense contract workers, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 in 1941. This order called for the participation of all U.S. citizens in defense programs regardless of race, creed, color, or national origin. The order also established the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC), which by 1943 was processing 8,000 employment discrimination complaints annually. The powers of the FEPC were decidedly limited. While the committee discouraged discrimination within the defense industry, it lacked the legal clout to enforce its desires. Over the next several years, both Presidents Truman and Eisenhower established committees on government contract compliance, but again enforcement power was absent. Only when President Kennedy created the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity were one of these groups given enforcement powers. Even in this case, however, the committee's legal authority was limited. Moreover, Kennedy's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, like its predecessors, dealt only with discrimination within businesses that had government contracts, not workplace discrimination in the overall private sector. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 changed this by addressing discrimination in all areas of employment. EEOC ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's enforcement program manages between more than 80,000 charges annually. In the EEOC system, charges are prioritized into one of three categories for purposes of investigation and resource allocation: A (top priority charges to which offices devote substantial investigative and settlement efforts); B (charges deemed to have merit but needing additional investigation); and C (charges judged to be unsupported or not under the EEOC's jurisdiction, and thus are not pursued). In FY 2005 alone, the EEOC obtained nearly $173 million in benefits for charging parties through settlement and conciliation (excluding litigation awards). Litigation awards accounted for another $106 million in FY 2005. Under EEOC rules of operation and investigation, settlements between disputing parties are encouraged at all stages of the process. With this in mind, the EEOC maintains a mediation-based alternative dispute resolution program. "The mediation program," states the EEOC, "is guided by principles of informed and voluntary participation at all stages, confidential deliberation by all parties, and neutral mediators." In FY 2005, the EEOC resolved more than 7,900 charges via its mediation program. FILING A COMPLAINT WITH THE EEOC Anyone who feels that he or she has suffered workplace discrimination because of his or her race, age, physical disability, religion, sex, or national origin is eligible to file a complaint with the EEOC. Complaints or charges are generally filed at an EEOC office by the aggrieved party or by his or her designated agent. All charges must be filed in writing, preferably but not necessarily on the appropriate EEOC form, within 180 days of the occurrence of the act that is the reason the complaint is being filed. Complaints may be filed at any one of 50 district, area, local, and field EEOC offices throughout the United States. Upon receiving a discrimination charge the EEOC defers that charge to a state or local fair employment practices agency. This agency has either 60 or 120 days to act on the complaint (the allotted time depends on several factors). If no action is taken on the state or local level within that time the charge reverts back to the EEOC, which processes the charge on the 61st or 121st day. This becomes the official filing day of the complaint. Within 10 days of the filing date the EEOC notifies those parties charged with discrimination. The EEOC subsequently undertakes an investigation of the charge. If the investigation shows reasonable cause to believe that discrimination occurred, the Commission launches conciliation efforts. The reaching of an agreement between the two parties signals closure of the case. If such an agreement cannot be reached, the EEOC has the option of filing suit in court or the aggrieved party may file suit on his or her own. If no violation of Title VII is found, the EEOC removes itself from the case, though the party charging discrimination is still free to file suit in court within a specified time. EEOC Programs The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has established numerous programs designed to inform the public of EEOC activities and responsibilities. The Technical Assistance Program (TAPS) is a one-day educational seminar for unions and small and mid-size employers. This program highlights the rights of employers and employees under Title VII. In FY 2005, the EEOC conducted 50 TAPS that reached more than 6,000 participants. The Expanded Presence Program sends contact teams to areas that would otherwise have little immediate accessibility to the EEOC. The EEOC also sponsors a Federal Dispute Resolution Conference, aids state and local fair practices employment agencies, and maintains liaison programs with unions, civil rights organizations, and various federal, state and local government agencies. The EEOC's budget appropriation for FY 2004 was $325 million, while its FY 2005 budget was $327 million. Its roster of full-time employees stood at 2,640 at the end of FY 2005, a decline of about 660 employees over a two-decade period. In the meantime, however, the agency's enforcement obligations have "substantially expanded due to new statutory responsibilities," stated the EEOC. Most of these charges concern alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act or sexual harassment. Overall, charge filings increased from 62,000 in FY 1990 to approximately 125,00 in FY 2005.
